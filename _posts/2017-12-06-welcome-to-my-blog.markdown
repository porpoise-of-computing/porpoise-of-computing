Hi everybody!

I am the creator of the YouTube channel
[Porpoise of Computing](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmqFlHKXu99tVBF-Cp6EdnQ).
I create educational videos about various topic around computer science
and related technology.

On this blog I will be posting more in-depth analyses of the topics covered
in the videos, including any hands-on research I do when preparing the videos.

At the time of publication of this post, there still isn't much available on
this blog, that channel, my Twitter or GitHub, but I'm working hard to put
my content out there, so stay tuned!
